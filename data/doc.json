{"intro-no-diggity":[{"text":"I'm obsessed with how future generations will describe music from the 1990s. These will be the songs that our children's children think of as characterizing the decade, much like the way Sinatra or Elvis are emblematic of the 1950s."},{"text":"I imagine that the songs that will eventually become the '90s canon will include generation-defining tracks, such as BLACKstreet’s “No Diggity,” and I can see this new jack swing standard uniting parents and teens during the future weddings and Bar Mitzvahs of the 2050s."},{"text":"To see which 1990s songs will likely enter the canon, we'll use 2 million data points that I collected via a music quiz, which asked whether people recognized hundreds of ‘90s songs that charted in the top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100."}],"no-diggity-the-sign":[{"text":"The song peaks among people who were born in 1985, or were 13 years-old when the song came out in 1998 (i.e., it was definitely on rotation at middle-school dances). We also see a slow drop off among people who were 5 years-old and younger (or not born yet) in the year of its release."},{"text":"That drop-off rate between generations—Millennials to Gen Z—is our indicator for whether \"No Diggity\" is surviving the test of time."},{"text":"To make this a bit easier to read, we'll chart the person's age at release, rather than birth year. Here's another banger from the mid-nineties: \"The Sign\" by Ace of Base."}],"scroll-intro":[{"text":"Again, notice the decline in song recognition among people who were 5 years-old when \"The Sign\" was released in 1993. For those respondents who were born much later (i.e., anyone 20 years-old and younger at the time of writing), only about half recognized \"The Sign\" (millennial readers, this is when you can start feeling old)."},{"text":"You're probably seeing a trend here: music has a half-life. Songs are less recognizable to people who weren't around during its prime year of popularity. Find someone 10-15 years your junior, and the likelihood that they'll know your teenage music references is lower than you think."},{"text":"How much lower? An easy way to see this is by charting the songs that every millennial knows (there are songs that were recognized by 90-100% of people who were 15 when the song was released)."}],"intro-mean":[{"text":"Here we see that Father Time acts indiscriminately: song knowledge erodes with each passing year. This is why I shouldn't be shocked that my Gen Z colleague has never heard \"The Sign,” or that teens are filming themselves listening to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" for the first time. This is a normal part of the music aging process."}],"wild-west":[{"text":"An especially somber example if this decay is \"Wild Wild West\" by Will Smith. In 1999, this was the song of the summer, and was pretty much inescapable. Yet it is fading far faster than any other '90s hit with comparable popularity."}],"popular":[{"text":"Other songs, meanwhile, remain unusually resilient. Why have these songs transcended their immediate generation? One theory is that they were so remarkably popular and culturally pervasive that they continued to be played. ”Jump Around\" still comes on during timeouts at sporting events. \"Macarena\" is still a Bar Mitzvah mainstay. \"I Will Always Love You\" is Whitney Houston's magnum opus. And, while there are countless reasons for a song to stay culturally relevant, it's not merely a function of popularity in the year of release."}],"millennial-only":[{"text":"There’s another fascinating subset of music: the songs that are markers of a generation not because they persist, but because their awareness is so localized to a particular generation that people outside of that cohort hardly know them. For millennials, these songs include K-Ci and JoJo’s “All My Life,” the quintessential teenage love ballad, and Savage Garden’s “Truly Madly Deeply.”"}],"lollipop":[{"text":"To see how well millennials and members of generation z know other ‘90s hits, check out the chart below."}],"story":[{"data-previous-step":"none","data-step":"slide1","text":"Here we see that Father Time acts indiscriminately: song knowledge erodes over time [highlight average].
